# scripts
This repository contains scripts (well, currently only one) I've developed to simplify my own life. Maybe you'll find these useful, too.

## organizer.sh
bash script to organize files by date

Copies or moves files from one directory to another (or even into the same directory) creating `year/month/` subdirectory structure. Run
```
./organizer.sh -h
```
for usage information.
